**YukiHub** is a Galgame / visual novel management and launcher tool for Android. It is suitable for managing local games, Android app-style games, emulator game entries, external program shortcuts, and play records.

Its goal is to integrate "game library management, quick launch, data synchronization, and usage statements" into a unified dark interface.

Developers are also welcome to actively build different branch versions. As the first mobile Gal frontend, there are still many shortcomings. Let's keep improving it together meow (⌯ᵔᗜᵔ⌯)/

## Project Positioning

YukiHub is closer to a **local game management hub** rather than a simple launcher.

It is suitable for the following scenarios:

- Managing locally installed games
- Managing Android app-style game entries
- Managing external launch entries
- Organizing shortcuts in one place
- Recording and synchronizing play records
- Migrating game data between multiple devices

---

## Core Features

### 1. Game Management

Supports adding, editing, and deleting game entries, and provides unified management for different types of launch entries.

### 2. Empty-directory Entry Support

For games or app entries that do not require a local directory, the directory field is not mandatory.

This is especially useful for the following scenarios:

- Directly launching Android apps
- Entries launched by package name
- External program entries
- Custom quick-launch entries

### 3. GameHub Shortcut Import

Supports importing shortcuts from GameHub and provides:

- Icon display
- Search and filtering
- A clearer list selection experience

### 4. Synchronization

Supports synchronization import/export of game data and play records, suitable for local backup or multi-device migration. It also supports ☁️ WebDAV cloud synchronization.

During synchronization, matching will be attempted based on the following information:

- root path
- local ID
- game title

For empty-directory entries, title matching is prioritized.

### 5. Disclaimer System

- The full disclaimer can be viewed in Settings
- The disclaimer must be accepted on first launch before entering
- Helps with open-source release and clarifies usage boundaries

## Tutorial Area

### Import Winlator and G-station games and launch them directly

</a>
</p>

- Notes:
  - The modified Winlator emulator package is based on the modified version by hostei2. `XServerDisplayActivity exported=false` was changed to `android:exported="true"` to expose the Activity for direct launch.
  - G-station games are based on the original version 5.3.5, with MT file extractor injection and Activity exposure. That is, add or change `android:exported="true"` for `android:name="com.xj.landscape.launcher.ui.gamedetail.GameDetailActivity"` in AndroidManifest.

### Tutorial for using WebDAV data cloud synchronization

### Currently Known Issues

- 1. Direct launching KRKR games with TF currently seems not to work ( )

- 2. Due to storage read/write restrictions on Huawei and some other phones, KRKR, Artemis and other engine games may not play normally. (An external private save option has been added. You can try enabling it; maybe it helps? A lightweight SAF option has also been added 🤔. Whether it works still depends on your testing.) (Feature entry is shown below ↓)

- That's all. PRs from capable people are welcome meow 😽😽😽
